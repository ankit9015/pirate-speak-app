# pirate-speak-app

This is a fun web app that takes an input message in English and converts it into Pirate speech.

The program is built using Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and fun translation API.



I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
